    "\n",
    "In recent years, the use of machine learning, and deep learning, in pharmaceutical research has shown promising results in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. In this talktorial, we get familiar with the basics of neural networks. We will learn how to build a simple two layer neural network and train it on a subset of ChEMBL data in order to predict the pIC50 values of compounds against EGFR, the target of interest. Furthermore, we select three compounds from an external, unlabeled data set that are predicted to be the most active against that kinase."

    "When starting with a neural network, the parameters, i.e. the weights and biases, are randomly initialized. The inputs are then fed into the network and produce an output. However, the corresponding output will most likely be very different from the true value. In other words, the prediction error will be very poor: the loss function is far from being minimal. Therefore, the initial parameters have to be optimized to obtain better predictions.\n",

    "To this end, we need to minimize the loss function. An efficient way to find such a minimum is to use the [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent#:~:text=Gradient%20descent%20is%20a%20first,the%20direction%20of%20steepest%20descent.) algorithm. This optimization scheme is iterative and uses both the derivative of the loss function (or gradient in the multivariate case) and a learning rate. The main idea behind the algorithm is to follow the steepest direction of the function, obtained with the gradient and managing the length of each step with the learning rate. The latter is often referred to as a hyperparameter, which can be tuned using cross-validation (more details in future talktorials).\n",

    "- **Prepare the data** − Foremost for any machine learning algorithm, we process, filter and select only the required information from the data. Then, the data is split into training and test data sets. The test data is used to evaluate the prediction of the algorithm and to cross check the efficiency of the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Define the model** - In keras, every ANN is represented by keras [models](https://keras.io/api/models/model/#model-class). Keras provides a way to create a model which is called [sequential](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/). The layers are arranged sequentially where the data flows from one layer to another layer in a given order until the data finally reaches the output layer. Each layer in the ANN can be represented by a *keras layer*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compile the model** − The compilation is the final step in creating a model. Once the compilation is done, we can move on to the training phase. A _loss function_ and an _optimizer_ are required in the learning phase to define the prediction error and to minimize it, respectively. In the practical part of this talktorial, we use the mean squared error as a loss and the [adam](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/) optimizer, which is a popular version of gradient descent and has shown to give good results in a wide range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fit the model** - The actual learning process will be done in this phase using the training data set. We can call the [fit()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) method which needs several parameters such as $x$ the input data, $y$ the target data, the batch size, the number of epochs, etc. An _epoch_ is when the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluate model** − We can evaluate the model by looking at the loss function between the predicted and true values of the test data using the [evaluate()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#evaluate-method) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scatter plots are a common and simple approach to visualize the evaluation of a model. They plot the predicted vs. true values. If the fit was perfect, we should see the $y=x$ line, meaning that the predicted value is exactly the true value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "   -  The sigmoid curve looks like a *S*-shaped curve as shown in the figure below. \n",
    "   - It has a \"smooth gradient\" which prevents jumps in the output values and it bounds the output values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "   - It is recommended to be used only on the output layer so that the output can be interpreted as probabilities. \n",
    "   - If you notice in the figure below, for $x$ values between -2.5 to 2.5, $y$ values are very steep, so any small change in values of $x$ in that region will cause value of $y$ to change significantly. It tends to bring the activations to either side of the curve.\n",
    "   - However, for very high or very low values of $x$, there is almost no change in the $y$ values, causing a [**vanishing gradient**](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-vanishing-exploding-gradient-problem-in-deep-neural-networks-191358470c11) problem. This can cause the network to learn slowly or even refuse to learn further. \n",
